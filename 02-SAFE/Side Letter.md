Re:	**Pro Rata, Information, MFN and Other Rights**

Dear ____,

This letter (the “Agreement”) will confirm our agreement that Bloomberg Beta 2022 L.P. (the “Investor”) shall be entitled to the following contractual pro rata, information, MFN and other rights in respect of [Company], a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), effective and contingent upon its purchase of a simple agreement for future equity with a “Post-Money Valuation Cap” of the Company, dated on or about _____________, 2025 (the “SAFE”).  Capitalized terms used herein and not defined shall have the meanings given to them in the SAFE.

1. Pro Rata Right.  The Investor shall have the right to purchase its “pro rata share” of Standard Preferred Stock being sold in the Equity Financing (the “Pro Rata Right”).  “Pro rata share” for purposes of this Pro Rata Right is the ratio of (x) the number of shares of Capital Stock issued from the conversion of all of the Investor’s SAFEs with a “Post-Money Valuation Cap” to (y) the Company Capitalization.

2. Information Rights.  The Company shall deliver to the Investor the following (the “Information Rights”):
(a) As soon as practicable after the end of each fiscal year of the Company, and in any event within one hundred twenty (120) days after the end of each fiscal year of the Company, a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its subsidiaries, if any, as at the end of such fiscal year, and consolidated statements of income and cash flows of the Company and its subsidiaries, if any, for such year, certified by the Chief Financial Officer of the Company;
(b) As soon as practicable after the end of the first, second and third quarterly accounting periods in each fiscal year of the Company, and in any event within forty-five (45) days after the end of the first, second, and third quarterly accounting periods in each fiscal year of the Company, an unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its subsidiaries, if any, as of the end of each such quarterly period, and unaudited consolidated statements of income  and  cash  flows of  the  Company and  its  subsidiaries,  if  any,  for  such  period,  subject to changes resulting from normal year-end audit adjustments; and
(c) Promptly after the commencement thereof, notice of all suits, claims, proceedings or investigations that could materially and adversely affect the Company or any of its affiliates or with respect to the SAFE.

3. MFN Right.  The Company agrees that, until the earlier of (i) conversion of the SAFE pursuant to the closing of the next Equity Financing contemplated by the SAFE or (ii) immediately prior to the consummation of a Change of Control of the Company, if the Company shall offer any investment terms to another investor that are more favorable than those set forth in the SAFE (or any subsequent investment in the Company made by Investor), the same terms shall be automatically deemed to apply retroactively to any and all investments in the Company by Investor that do not have such investment terms that are more favorable, whether pursuant to the SAFE or otherwise.  The Company agrees to notify Investor promptly upon proposing to or receiving from another investor terms that are more favorable to the investor than those set forth in the SAFE (or any subsequent investment in the Company made by Investor), as supplemented by this Agreement. 

4. Minimum Conversion Threshold.  The Company agrees that the SAFE shall not automatically convert into shares of Preferred Stock unless the Company receives aggregate gross proceeds of not less than $3,000,000 (excluding the aggregate amount of convertible debt securities and simple agreements for future equity of the Company outstanding as of the date of this Agreement or issued after the date of this Agreement).  

5. Restriction on Digital Assets.  Without the prior written consent of the Investor, the Company shall not, directly or indirectly, through an affiliate or otherwise, sell, issue, sponsor, create or distribute any digital tokens, blockchain-based assets, cryptocurrency or any other digital assets, including through a Simple Agreement for Future Tokens or other agreement, pre-sale, initial coin offering, token distribution event or crowdfunding.

6. Termination/Survival of Rights.  The rights described in this Agreement are non-assignable (except to affiliates of the Investor) and shall terminate upon the earliest to occur of (a) the conversion of the SAFE pursuant to the closing of the next Equity Financing contemplated by the SAFE; provided, however, that the Pro Rata Right and Information Rights shall survive such closing to the extent Investor is not a “major investor” (or similar term or concept) that is entitled to receive similar such rights in the definitive documentation for the Equity Financing pursuant to which the SAFE converts, in which case, the parties hereto will make any amendments necessary to this Agreement so as to preserve such rights of the Investor under this Agreement, (b) the closing of a firm commitment underwriting public offering of the Company’s Common Stock registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (c) immediately prior to the consummation of Change of Control of the Company, or (d) such time as the Investor no longer qualifies as an “accredited investor,” as that term is then defined in Rule 501(a) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

7. Governing Law.  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed under the laws of the State of [Delaware], without regard to the conflicts of law provisions of such jurisdiction.

8. Inconsistency.  This Agreement and the SAFE constitute the full and entire understanding and agreement between the parties with regard to the subjects hereof and thereof.  In the event of any inconsistency between this Agreement and the SAFE, this Agreement shall control.
 
The undersigned hereby execute and deliver this Agreement as of the date first set forth above.  This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

Sincerely,  
[COMPANY]
