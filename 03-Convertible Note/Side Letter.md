1. Subject to the terms and conditions specified in this Agreement, the Company hereby grants to the Investor a right to purchase its Pro Rata Portion (as defined below) of the equity securities, or instruments convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for equity securities (the “*Equity Securities*”), issued by the Company in an Equity Financing (as defined below) at the price and on the terms such shares are offered to other investors in such Equity Financing (the "*Pro Rata Right*"). The Company shall give Investor a written notice of its bona fide intention to issue such Equity Securities, describing the type of Equity Securities and the price and the general terms upon which the Company proposes to issue such Equity Securities.  Investor shall have ten (10) days from the date such notice is effective, to agree in writing to purchase such Investor’s Pro Rata Portion of such Equity Securities.

2. "*Equity Financing*" shall mean a sale by the Company of Equity Securities, not including any equity issuance made primarily for non-financing purposes, as determined by the Company in its reasonable discretion.

3. The Investor's "*Pro Rata Portion*" shall mean no less than ___ percent.

    (a) As soon as practicable after the end of each fiscal year of the Company, and in any event within one hundred twenty (120) days after the end of each fiscal year of the Company, a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its subsidiaries, if any, as at the end of such fiscal year, and consolidated statements of income and cash flows of the Company and its subsidiaries, if any, for such year, certified by the Chief Financial Officer of the Company;

    (c) Promptly after the commencement thereof, notice of (i) all suits, claims, proceedings or investigations that could materially and adversely affect the Company or any of its affiliates or with respect to the Note Purchase Agreement or Note or (ii) the occurrence of any event which constitutes an Event of Default.

5. The Company agrees that that, until the earlier of (a) the closing of the next Equity Financing or (b) immediately prior to the consummation of a [Sale] of the Company, if the Company shall offer any more favorable investment terms to another investor, the same terms shall be automatically deemed to apply retroactively to any and all investments in the Company by Investor, whether pursuant to the Note or otherwise.

Sincerely,
