The rights provided by this *Section 7.12* shall terminate upon the earliest to occur of (i) immediately following the initial closing of the Next Equity Financing; *provided, however*, that such rights shall survive such closing to the extent such rights are not reflected in the definitive documentation for the Next Equity Financing or are not available to the Lender; and (ii) immediately prior to the consummation of Initial Public Offering or Corporate Transaction.

**7.13 Information Rights.** The Company shall furnish each Lender:

(a) annual unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries, including an unaudited consolidated balance sheet as of the end of the fiscal year, an unaudited consolidated statement of operations and an unaudited consolidated statement of cash flows of the Company and its subsidiaries for such fiscal year, within 120 days after the end of such fiscal year, prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied, certified by the chief financial officer of the Company;

(b) quarterly unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries, including an unaudited consolidated balance sheet as of the end of such fiscal quarter, an unaudited consolidated statement of operations and an unaudited consolidated statement of cash flows of the Company and its subsidiaries for such quarter, within 45 days after the end of such quarter, prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied, subject to changes resulting from normal year-end audit adjustments;

(c) a budget prior to fiscal year-end, subject to changes resulting from normal year-end audit adjustments; and

(d) promptly after the commencement thereof, notice of (i) all suits, claims, proceedings and investigations that could materially and adversely affect the Company or any of its affiliates or with respect to this Agreement or the Notes; and (ii) the occurrence of any event which constitutes an Event of Default.

The rights provided by this *Section 7.13* shall terminate upon the earliest to occur of (i) immediately following the initial closing of the Next Equity Financing; *provided, however*, that such rights shall survive such closing to the extent such rights are not reflected in the definitive documentation for the Next Equity Financing or are not available to the Lender; and (ii) immediately prior to the consummation of the Initial Public Offering or Corporate Transaction.

**7.14 Limitation on Senior Indebtedness.** The Company will not, directly or indirectly, incur, create, issue, assume, guarantee or otherwise become liable for any indebtedness or obligation that is senior in terms of right of repayment of the principal amount of such indebtedness or obligation to the indebtedness evidenced by the Notes.

**7.15 MFN Right.** The Company agrees that, until the earliest of (a) the closing of the Next Equity Financing or (b) immediately prior to the consummation of the Initial Public Offering or a Corporate Transaction, if the Company shall offer any more favorable investment terms to another investor, the same terms shall be automatically deemed to apply retroactively to any and all investments in the Company by the Lenders, whether pursuant to the Notes or otherwise. The Company agrees to notify the Lenders promptly upon proposing to receive from another investor terms that are more favorable to the Lender than those set forth in the Notes and this Agreement.

**7.16 Cryptocurrencies.** Without the prior written consent of the Majority Note Holders, the Company shall not, directly or indirectly, through an affiliate or otherwise, sell, issue, sponsor, create or distribute any digital tokens, blockchain-based assets, cryptocurrency or any other digital assets, including through a Simple Agreement for Future Tokens or other agreement, pre-sale, initial coin offering, token distribution event or crowdfunding.

**7.17 Stock Purchase Agreement.** Each Lender understands and agrees that the conversion of the Notes into Conversion Shares may require such Lender’s execution of certain agreements in the form agreed to by investors in the Next Equity Financing or the Non-Qualified Financing, as applicable, relating to the purchase and sale of such securities as well as registration, co sale, rights of first refusal, rights of first offer and voting rights, if any, relating to such securities.

**7.18 Exculpation Among Lenders.** Each Lender acknowledges that it is not relying upon any person, firm, corporation or stockholder, other than the Company and its officers and directors in their capacities as such, in making its investment or decision to invest in the Company. Each Lender agrees that no other Lender nor the respective controlling persons, officers, directors, partners, agents, stockholders or employees of any other Lender shall be liable for any action heretofore or hereafter taken or omitted to be taken by any of them in connection with the purchase and sale of the Securities.

**7.19 Further Assurance.** From time to time, the Company shall execute and deliver to the Lenders such additional documents and shall provide such additional information to the Lenders as any Lender may reasonably require to carry out the terms of this Agreement and the Notes and any agreements executed in connection herewith or therewith, or to be informed of the financial and business conditions and prospects of the Company.

### SCHEDULE OF LENDERS

## EXHIBIT A

### TERMS OF SERIES [A] PREFERRED STOCK

**Liquidation preference**: In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, the Preferred will have the right to receive the original purchase price plus declared but unpaid dividends prior to any distribution to the common stock. The remaining assets will be distributed pro rata to the holders of common stock. A sale of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets or a merger or consolidation of the Company with any other company or a change of control will be treated as a liquidation of the Company.

**Conversion**: The Preferred may be converted at any time, at the option of the holder, into shares of common stock. The conversion rate will initially be 1:1, subject to anti-dilution and other customary adjustments.

**Automatic conversion**: Each share of Preferred will automatically convert into common stock, at the then applicable conversion rate, upon (i) the closing of a firm commitment underwritten public offering of common stock, or (ii) the consent of the holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding shares of Preferred.

**Anti-dilution**: The conversion price of the Preferred will be subject to adjustment, on a broad-based weighted average basis, if the Company issues additional securities at a price per share less than the then applicable conversion price, subject to customary exceptions.

**General voting rights**: Each share of Preferred will have the right to a number of votes equal to the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of each such share of Preferred. The Preferred will vote with the common stock on all matters except as specifically provided herein or as otherwise required by law.

**Protective provisions**: So long as any of the Preferred is outstanding, consent of the holders of at least a majority of the Preferred will be required for any action that: (i) alters any provision of the certificate of incorporation if it would adversely alter the rights, preferences, privileges or powers of the Preferred; (ii) changes the authorized number of shares; (iii) authorizes a new series of preferred stock having rights senior to or on parity with the Preferred; (iv) redeems or repurchases any shares (other than pursuant to employee or consultant agreements); (v) declares or pays any dividend; (vi) changes the number of directors; (vii) approves any merger, sale of assets or other corporate reorganization or acquisition, including any change of control, or any liquidation or dissolution, or (viii) sells, issues, sponsors, creates or distributes any digital tokens, blockchain-based assets, cryptocurrency or any other digital assets, including through a Simple Agreement for Future Tokens or other agreement, pre-sale, initial coin offering, token distribution event or crowdfunding.

**Right to maintain proportionate ownership**: Each holder of Preferred (or one or more of its affiliates) will have a right to purchase its *pro rata* share of any offering of new securities by the Company, subject to customary exceptions. The *pro rata* share will be based on the ratio of (x) the number of shares of common stock held by such holder (on an as-converted basis) to (y) the Company’s outstanding fully-diluted capitalization (on an as-converted and as-exercised basis).

**Right of first refusal**: Holders of Preferred will have a right of first refusal, second to the Company’s right, with respect to sales of common stock by the Company’s founders.

**Information rights**:	As soon as practicable, the Company will deliver to each holder of Preferred (i) an unaudited balance sheet as of fiscal year end and (ii) unaudited statements of income and cash flows for such fiscal year. The information rights will terminate upon an initial public offering
