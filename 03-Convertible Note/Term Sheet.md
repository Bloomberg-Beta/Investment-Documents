**Term of Notes**: 24 months from the date of the note purchase agreement (the “*Maturity Date*”).

**Conversion Upon Qualified Financing**: Upon a Qualified Financing (as defined below), the principal amount of the Notes, together with all accrued and unpaid interest, will automatically be converted into that number of shares of the class and/or series of the Company's equity securities that are sold in the Qualified Financing (the "*New Securities*") determined by dividing (i) the total amount of principal and accrued interest on the Notes at the time of such closing, by (ii) the lesser of (A) 80% of the per share purchase price of the New Securities sold in the Qualified Financing, or (B) the price obtained by dividing $__________ (the “***Valuation Cap***”) by the Company’s fully-diluted capitalization immediately prior to the Qualified Financing (including any shares reserved for issuance under any equity plan and any increase to the number of shares reserved for issuance made in connection with such financing).

A "*Qualified Financing*" shall mean a preferred stock financing led by one or more institutional investors (which may include one or more of the Investors) in which the Company receives aggregate gross proceeds of at least $3,000,000, excluding conversion of the Notes.

**Optional Conversion upon Non-Qualified Financing**: Upon an equity financing that does not qualify as a Qualified Financing (a "*Non-Qualified Financing*"), each Investor will have the option, exercisable in its sole discretion, to convert the principal amount of its Note, together with all accrued and unpaid interest, into the equity securities issuable in the Non-Qualified Financing upon the same terms and conditions that would be applicable if the Non-Qualified Financing were to qualify as a Qualified Financing.  In the event of such conversion, all references herein to the "Qualified Financing" will be references to such Non-Qualified Financing.

**Optional Conversion upon Maturity**: If neither a Qualified Financing nor a Non-Qualified Financing has occurred prior to the Maturity Date, each Investor will have the option, exercisable in its sole discretion, to convert the principal amount of its Note, together with all accrued and unpaid interest, into shares of Series [A] Preferred Stock (the “*Series [A] Preferred*”), at a conversion price obtained by dividing the Valuation Cap by the Company’s fully-diluted capitalization (including any shares reserved for issuance under any equity plan).

**Sale of the Company**: Upon any Sale of the Company (as defined below) while the Notes are outstanding, the Notes will become immediately due and payable and the Company will pay the Investors an amount equal to two times (2x) the sum of outstanding principal of and accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes, and the Notes will be deemed repaid in full and terminated; *provided, however*, that at the option of each Investor, in lieu of such payment, the Investor may elect to convert its Note (and all accrued interest thereon) into shares of the Company’s Common Stock immediately prior to the Sale of the Company, at a conversion price equal to the lesser of (x) the price per share of Common Stock paid by the acquirer or as consideration for each share of Common Stock in a Sale, and (y) the price per share obtained by dividing the Valuation Cap by the Company’s fully-diluted and outstanding capitalization. For this purpose, a "*Sale of the Company*" means, generally, any reorganization, merger, sale, or other disposition to an unaffiliated third party of majority voting control of the Company or all or substantially all of the Company’s assets, or an exclusive license, or any liquidation or dissolution of the Company, in any such case whether directly or indirectly in any transaction or series of related transactions.
